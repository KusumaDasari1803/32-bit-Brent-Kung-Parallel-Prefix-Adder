# Comparative Analysis of 32-bit Adders (Vivado Synthesis)

## 1. Critical Path Delay and Slack

* Ripple-Carry Adder (RCA): 4.857 ns data path delay, 12.164 ns required time, 7.114 ns arrival time, 5.050 ns slack
* Flat 32-bit Brent–Kung (BK): 2.636 ns data path delay, 12.164 ns required time, 4.893 ns arrival time, 7.271 ns slack
* Modular 8-bit Brent–Kung (4×8-bit): 2.414 ns data path delay, 12.164 ns required time, 4.664 ns arrival time, 7.586 ns slack

**Observation:** Both Brent–Kung designs are ~2× faster than ripple-carry.

## 2. Logic Depth (Levels of Logic)

* RCA: 16 levels
* Flat BK: 5 levels
* Modular BK: 4 levels

**Observation:** Brent–Kung drastically reduces logic depth vs ripple-carry.

---

## 3. Resource Utilization

* RCA: ~32 LUTs, 98 FFs
* Flat BK: ~57 LUTs, 98 FFs
* Modular BK: ~57 LUTs, 98 FFs

**Observation:** Ripple-carry is area-efficient but slower; BK uses more LUTs but enables higher speed.

---

## 4. Key Takeaways

* RCA: Best for low area, not for high-speed designs.
* Flat BK: Balanced prefix adder with moderate resource cost.
* Modular BK: Fastest in this study, good trade-off of speed vs resources.
